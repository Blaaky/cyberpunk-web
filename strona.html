    <h1>What is Cyberpunk 2077?</h1>
    <p>
      Cyberpunk 2077 is based off a tabletop role-playing game also called "Cyberpunk" written by Mike Pondsmith and
      first published by R. Talsorian Games in 1988. The creators of Cyberpunk 2077, CDProjekt Red, have re-created the
      tabletop game and turned it into a video RPG. Though the game was heavily delayed with it's announcment being in
      2012 and release being in the end of 2020. After the release of the game, Cyberpunk 2077 faced a lot of backlash
      because of the huge amount of bugs and glitches and a lot of features that were said to be in the game have been
      missing and to this day, some still are like multiplayer and wall-running. However with every new version being
      released, Cyberpunk became more and more refined. Two years after the release of Cyberpunk came out an anime
      called "Cyberpunk:Edgerunners" created by CD PRojekt RED nad Studio Trigger. And now, almost three years after the
      initial release, the game is getting it's very own DLC called "Phantom Liberty" set to release on Septmeber 25th
      2023.

      As a Cyberpunk player who plays the game for almost two years now, I must say the experience is quite astonishing.
      I've had a lot of fun playing as V. The graphics are are very good. The soundtracks are created so you can listen
      to them for hours without getting bored. The main story line doesn't miss anything, the endings are all amazing
      with every being different depending on your final choice. All of the characters are also very well built and have
      a lot of different dialogue options that can affect the relationship with the main character and the side
      character. The game also doesn't lack side jobs as there are a lot you can complete, so you can prepare to spend
      some time completing the entire game.

      >Overall Cyberpunk is a very good game, even though it had a bad start it still managed to get back on it's feet
      and rise to be one of the many great games available. Even after the huge delay of Cyberpunk, the game has became
      one of the most well known games world-wide whether that's because of how popular it got because of it's delays or
      because of how good and enjoyable it is.
