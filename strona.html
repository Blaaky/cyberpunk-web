    <h1>What is <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/pl/pl/" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077</a>?</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/pl/pl/" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077</a> is based off a tabletop role-playing
      game also called "Cyberpunk" written by Mike Pondsmith and first published by R. Talsorian Games in 1988. The
      creators of <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/pl/pl/" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, CDProjekt Red, have
      re-created the tabletop game and turned it into a video RPG. Though the game was heavily delayed with it's
      announcment being in 2012 and release being in the end of 2020. After the release of the game,
      <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/pl/pl/" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077</a> faced a lot of backlash because of
      the huge amount of bugs and glitches and a lot of features that were said to be in the game have been missing and
      to this day, some still are like multiplayer and wall-running. However with every new version being released,
      <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/pl/pl/" target="_blank">Cyberpunk</a> became more and more refined. Two years
      after the release of Cyberpunk came out an anime called "<a
        href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/edgerunners"
        target="_blank"
        >Cyberpunk:Edgerunners</a
      >" created by CD PRojekt RED nad Studio Trigger. And now, almost three years after the initial release, the game
      is getting it's very own DLC called "<a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/us/en/phantom-liberty" target="_blank"
        >Phantom Liberty</a
      >" set to release on Septmeber 25th 2023.

      As a <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/pl/pl/" target="_blank">Cyberpunk</a> player who plays the game for almost
      two years now, I must say the experience is quite astonishing. I've had a lot of fun playing as V. The graphics
      are are very good. The soundtracks are created so you can listen to them for hours without getting bored. The main
      story line doesn't miss anything, the endings are all amazing with every being different depending on your final
      choice. All of the characters are also very well built and have a lot of different dialogue options that can
      affect the relationship with the main character and the side character. The game also doesn't lack side jobs as
      there are a lot you can complete, so you can prepare to spend some time completing the entire game.

    <p>
      Overall <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/pl/pl/" target="_blank">Cyberpunk</a> is a very good game, even though
      it had a bad start it still managed to get back on it's feet and rise to be one of the many great games available.
      Even after the huge delay of <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/pl/pl/" target="_blank">Cyberpunk</a>, the game
      has became one of the most well known games world-wide whether that's because of how popular it got because of
      it's delays or because of how good and enjoyable it is.
